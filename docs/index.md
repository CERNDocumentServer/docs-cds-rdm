!!! Note

    This documentation site is still a work in progress. We are in the process of completing the missing parts.

CDS (CERN Document Server) is the **CERN Institutional Repository**.
It preserves and disseminates CERN's research outputs — including **publications, software, datasets, departmental documents, and multimedia materials** — ensuring their long-term accessibility.

## In a nutshell

CDS is the place to archive your **final, official documents** that need to be preserved for the long term.
When you deposit a document in CDS, it becomes part of CERN's permanent record and will be retained for the lifetime of the Organization.

Deposits can be made **public** or **restricted** to specific audiences (e.g. CERN users only).

!!! warning "Record deletion"

    Once a record is published, it **cannot be deleted**.
    A short **grace period** is available to correct mistakes. See our [Content Policy](https://repository.cern/content-policy) for details.

## Permitted content

You can find detailed guidance in our [Content Policy](https://repository.cern/content-policy), but in general CDS is intended for:

- Final versions of CERN research publications
- Datasets and software releases
- Departmental and administrative documents meant for long-term preservation
- Official multimedia (e.g. photos)

## Other content

CDS is **not** the right place for:

- **Personal** documents or multimedia
- **Work-in-progress** materials or drafts
- **Temporary** files or items not meant for archival preservation

For such content, evaluate using [CERNBox](https://cernbox.cern.ch) instead.
