# Access & Share

Until published, your upload is accessible only to you; it is not visible or findable in CDS.

To grant others viewing or editing access to your upload, click the **Share** button:

The Share interface lets you specify which users and e-groups can access the upload, and assign granular permissions. You can also generate shareable links that can be sent to colleagues who cannot log in to CDS.

In the **Visibility** section you can change the access settings that will apply when your upload is published. You can restrict access to the entire record (metadata and files) or restrict only the files:

### Enable access requests

For published records with restricted file access (while metadata remains public), you can enable **access requests**. When an unauthenticated or unauthorized user views the record page, they will see a **Request access** form instead of a permission error:

![Request access form shown to unauthorized users](images/record-files-access-request.jpg)

You can enable or disable access requests from the Share interface (available on both the upload and the record page):

![Enable access requests from the Share interface](images/share-access-request.jpg)

When configuring access requests you can:

- Allow requests only from logged-in users, or also from anonymous users.
- Add a help text that will be displayed to users who are not authorized to access the files.

When an unauthorized user requests access, you (or the designated approver) will receive an email notification to approve or deny the request.

## Who can access

### Drafts

The uploader always has access to their drafts. Any users, e-groups, or recipients of shareable links defined in the Share interface will also be able to access and perform the permitted actions.

### Records

Any sharing permissions defined during upload are persisted on publish.

When a record belongs to one or more communities, **all community members can access** the record. Community curators, managers, and owners **can also edit** the record.

## Record versions

Visibility and sharing permissions apply **only to the specific version** of a record. When you create a new version, visibility and sharing settings must be re-defined.

Community members **can access all versions** of a record.

## Restricted communities

When a record is included in a restricted community, its visibility can only be restricted. Restricted communities cannot contain public records.
