# Upload

To upload new content, first login with your CERN account by clicking on the login button on the top-right corner of any page.

!!! Tip

    Only CERN and federated accounts (EduGain) can login to CDS.

The easiest way to initiate a new upload is to first **find the community** where you want to upload.
You can read more about communities [here](../communities/communities.md).

You can find the communities that you manage or search for other communities by clicking
on the **Communities** menu in the top header:

![Communities](images/communities.jpg)

Then, click on the **New upload** green button:

![Upload to a community](images/communities-new-upload.jpg){ width="600" }

You will now see the deposit form.

## Files

Click the **Upload files** button, or drag and drop one or more files onto the drop zone to start uploading files.
By default, you can maximum upload up to 100 files and a total of 50GB.

!!! Warning

    Make sure that you have uploaded all your files before **Publishing**: you won't be able to edit files afterwards.

### Embargo

You can define embargo policies for your files by restricting access to files and selecting the option **Apply an embargo**:

## Required metadata

For each upload, you will have to fill in the following mandatory information:

- **Title**: input the title of your upload.
- **Resource type**: select one of the available resource types. Please [contact us](../index.md#need-help) if you are unsure.
- **Author/Creators**: fill in all the authors or creators of your deposit. When adding authors, it is recommended to search the name in the auto-complete box. CDS is regularly synced with the [ORCiD](https://orcid.org) and CERN users databases.

## DOIs

You might want to get a DOI for your upload. When you select select the option `No, I need one`, CDS will automatically register a new DOI on publish. If you wish, you can reserve a DOI using the `Get a DOI now!` button.

![DOI - I need one](images/DOI_I_need.jpg)

If you already have a DOI from an external source, you can provide it:

![DOI - External](images/DOI_external.jpg)

It is important to avoid multiple DOIs for the same upload: if already have an external DOI, please use that one.

Given that the metadata information are sent to DataCite when registering the DOI, you cannot get a DOI for fully restricted uploads.

!!! tip

    When requesting a DOI, CDS will register two DOIs. Read more on the [DOI versioning FAQ](https://repository.cern/help/versioning).

## Other metadata fields

The deposit form allows you to be very descriptive and insert a high amount of metadata information to describe your uploads.
Below you can find a quick guide to metadata fields.

- **Licenses and Copyright**: define the license and copyright information for your upload.
- **CERN fields**: describe your upload by adding information about the CERN experiments, accelerators, departments, etc. when applicable
- **Publishing**: ...

## Access

Refer to the [Access & Share](access-share.md) help page to learn how to change access restrictions.

## Preview, Save and Publish

You can preview and save your upload any time by clicking on the **Preview** and **Save** buttons:

![Preview and Save](images/deposit-actions.jpg){ width="300" }

When you are ready, you can publish your upload by clicking on the **Publish** button.
You will need to agree with the CDS terms & conditions, content policy and Operational Circular 6.

![Publish](images/deposit-publish.jpg){ width="500" }
