Who can upload

## Required metadata

Title, resource type, authors/creators

### Resource type

## DOIs

When you select select the option `No, I need one` in the form field `Do you already have a DOI for this upload?`, CDS will automatically register a new DOI on publish. If you wish, you can reserve a DOI using the `Get a DOI now!` button.

If you already have a DOI from an external source, you can provide it:

![DOI - External](images/DOI_external.jpg)

It is important to avoid multiple DOIs for the same publication: if already have an external DOI, please use that one.

When requesting a DOI, CDS will register two DOIs. Read more on the [DOI versioning FAQ](https://repository.cern/help/versioning).
